This file contains information and sample SAS programs to create 3 permanent                        
SAS datasets for users who want to use SAS in processing the PUF2021 transport data file                              
provided in this PUF release.                                                                       
                                                                                                    
Section A provides a sample SAS program to convert the SAS transport data files into a                             
regular SAS datasets using the SAS procedure: CIMPORT.  

Section B creates a format library.

Section C creates and applies labels to the datasets, which it saves as 3 permanent datasets 
(PUF2021_1_FALL, PUF2021_2_WINTER, PUF2021_3_SUMMER) in the specified location (library PUFLIB)
